            Hi my name is Stef. I'm not a Cyborg but I work on a Cyborg Team.
            This isn't hyperbole or sci-fi. This is a team that is part human and part machine.

            How do we know we have a Cyborg team?
            <p>When you look closely at the inside guts of an organism like a fish,
            all you see is goop. But when you take a step back you see it for what
            it does, how it acts, and it's an amazing creature.</p>
            <p>When you look at a bot's internal guts, all you see is shell scripts
            REST calls, and various other tools, but when you take a step back, you
            see it how it acts, a team member.</p>

        <aside class="notes">
            It is comparatively easy to make computers exhibit adult level performance on intelligence tests or playing checkers, and difficult or impossible to give them the skills of a one-year-old when it comes to perception and mobility.
